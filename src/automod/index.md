# Overview

Sentry's automod feature is very powerful. It allows you to create your own custom rules to evaluate against messages
that are sent in your server.

Each automod rule consists of one or more [conditions](./conditions.md) and one or more [actions](./actions.md) to be
taken if all of the conditions are met.
