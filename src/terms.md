# Sentry Bot Terms of Use

By using Sentry, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

## No Warranty

Sentry is provided with absolutely no warranty or guarantee of future service. While we will make every effort to keep
Sentry running with uptime as close to 100% as possible, systems do fail and Sentry may become unavailable from time to
time. Additionally, defects and changes in Discord's systems may cause features to stop working properly.

## Abuse

We reserve the right to terminate our relationship with you at any time for actions which we deem as abusive. Abusive
actions include, but are not limited to denial of service attacks, flooding the bot with bogus commands, or otherwise
exploiting a defect or vulnerability in Sentry's programming.

## Privacy

Your privacy and the privacy of your server members are very important to us. Check out the [privacy policy](/privacy)
for a full listing of data we collect and how we protect it.
