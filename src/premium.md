# Premium

[Get Premium](https://sentrybot.gg/dashboard/premium)

Most of Sentry's features are available for free, but some special features require a Premium subscription. Premium
currently costs $6/month for the first server, and $4/month for every additional server after your first.

## Why?

Certain features require a Premium membership in order to offset the cost of development and hosting Sentry. Sentry is
a complex bot, programmed over the course of many months. Sentry also requires servers to run; Sentry's powerful
[automod](./automod/index.md) feature requires Sentry to test every single message sent in every server Sentry is a
member of against a number of complex, user-defined rules. This consumes server time.

We hope that the base features available for free in Sentry will provide you with enough value that you decide to
upgrade to Premium.

## Premium Credits

If you want to upgrade a server to Premium, you will need to buy a Premium Credit. If you don't yet have any premium
credits, you can get your first one by clicking the **Get Premium** button on the [Premium](https://sentrybot.gg/dashboard/premium)
page in the Sentry Bot Dashboard.

If you already have one or more premium credits, you can add more or cancel some or all of your premium credits by clicking
the **Manage Subscription** button on the Premium page.

Both buttons will redirect you to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) to securely complete your purchase.

Newly-purchased premium credits become available to you immediately. You will need to manually choose which server(s)
you want to apply your unassigned premium credits to. Once you assign a credit to a server, that server will immediately
be upgraded to Premium.

If you reduce your quantity of premium credits without canceling your entire subscription, those credits are immediately
removed. If you cancel your entire subscription or your payment method expires or is declined, all of your credits will
be removed when your subscription would normally be due to renew.

When removing expired or canceled premium credits, we first remove credits that aren't assigned to any servers. Then,
we remove credits starting with the credit that was most recently assigned to a server. That is, servers that have had
premium for the shortest period of time are considered first when removing active credits. If you want to manually
choose which server(s) are canceled when you cancel some of your credits, you should first manually unassign those
credits using the "Remove Premium" button.

## What do I get?

Right now, you get these perks for upgrading to Premium:

### A special role in the Sentry support server

All Premium subscribers get a special **Premium** role in the [Sentry Bot Support](https://discord.gg/MBpzsxF5HX) Discord server.

In addition to granting you a yellow name, the Premium role also grants you access to private supporters-only support
channels.

Unlike other Premium benefits, the role is only available to the Discord user who has the Premium subscription. It does
not apply to an entire Discord server. The Premium role is applied to you as long as you have at least one active Premium
credit, and are in the Sentry Bot Support server.

### Private thread member notifications

<BoostFeatureRequired feature="private threads" level="2" />

Premium servers can choose to have Sentry send notifications to their members using [private threads](./settings.md#member-notifications).

### Report threads

<BoostFeatureRequired feature="private threads" level="2" />

Premium servers have the ability to directly open [private threads](./commands.md#mod-thread-channel) with reporters in
order to request additional context or evidence for a report.

### More to come

There are many new features planned for Sentry to come in the future. See the [upcoming features](./upcoming.md) page
for a glimpse at some of them.
